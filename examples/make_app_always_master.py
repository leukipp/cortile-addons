"""Make a specific application always master.

When cortile is running and a pre-defined application is launched,
it will make the application a master window on the current layout.
The application will be selected based on the class name(s), which
are passed as command line arguments [see TODO]. Applications
will be made master only if there where just recently opened.

Authors:
    * https://github.com/leukipp/

Dependencies:
    The following packages have to be installed::

        $ pip install cortile

Usage:
    Run the python application (TODO: pass class names of applications).
    Within the cortile 'addons' folder this script will not work, since
    arguments can't be passed.::

        $ python make_app_always_master.py firefox code
