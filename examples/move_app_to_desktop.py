"""Automatically open applications on specific desktop.

When cortile is running and a pre-defined application is launched,
it will automatically relocate the application to a designated desktop.
This behavior is determined by the applications class name(s). Both the class
name(s) and the target desktop are hardcoded into the system [see TODO]. This
ensures that each application is consistently moved to its appropriate desktop.

Authors:
    * https://github.com/leukipp/

Dependencies:
    The following packages have to be installed::

        $ pip install cortile

Usage:
    Run the python application::

        $ python move_app_to_desktop.py
